## Abstract

This repository contains the full manuscript, experimental data, and supplementary material for a study investigating the magnetic response of a DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) sample under a specially designed helical magnetic field configuration at the magic angle (~54.74°).

The experimental results demonstrate a significant and reproducible deviation from expected paramagnetic behavior, suggesting a transition toward weak ferromagnetism under the applied field geometry.

The repository is structured to ensure full reproducibility of the reported results, including raw measurement data, supplementary derivations, and design files for the experimental apparatus.
